window_size -> (8,6) -> (800,600)?
Programmable camera
Programmable light source
Scene should keep track of all shaders, and write Uniform data to each of them per draw loop
New Material class, inside RenderedObject (ambient, diffuse, specular, texture, color, etc.)
New functions in RenderedObject to make writing Sphere and future objects easier
GLM interface pybind11 to avoid "property" calls? --- Replace GLM with Eigen entirely

"Sphere.position[1] = cos(...)" should be valid if possible --- use Ref<vec3> and a Python wrapper class to contain a float32 numpy array
