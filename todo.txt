* New Material class, inside RenderedObject (ambient, diffuse, specular, texture, color, etc.), and RenderedObject.set_attributes(shader)
* RenderedObject should not have color
* New functions in RenderedObject to make writing Sphere and future objects easier

Separate pyb files
Breakup scene into hpp/cpp files (lights, window, callback)
Replace GLM with Eigen
Use Uniform Buffer Objects to set the view and projection matrix for all shaders
window_size -> (8,6) -> (800,600)?
Programmable camera
Programmable light source (multiple lights, DirectionalLight)
auto camera: when scene.run() is called, iterative over objects to find CoM and extent to auto-set properties of the camera (option to override if camera is set explicitly)
