shared_ptr for objects so that scene.draw(sphere(...)) works
GLM interface pybind11 to avoid "property" calls? --- Replace GLM with Eigen entirely
window_size -> (8,6) -> (800,600)?
Programmable camera
Programmable light source
Scene should keep track of all shaders, and write Uniform data to each of them per draw loop
New Material class, inside RenderedObject (ambient, diffuse, specular, texture, color, etc.)
New functions in RenderedObject to make writing Sphere and future objects easier
Use Uniform Buffer Objects to set the view and projection matrix for all shaders
