* GLM interface pybind11 to avoid "property" calls? --- Replace GLM with Eigen entirely
* separte into hpp/cpp files
* New Material class, inside RenderedObject (ambient, diffuse, specular, texture, color, etc.)
* New functions in RenderedObject to make writing Sphere and future objects easier

Use Uniform Buffer Objects to set the view and projection matrix for all shaders
window_size -> (8,6) -> (800,600)?
Programmable camera
Programmable light source (multiple lights, DirectionalLight)
auto camera: when scene.run() is called, iterative over objects to find CoM and extent to auto-set properties of the camera (option to override if camera is set explicitly)
